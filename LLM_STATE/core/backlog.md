## Tasks

### R7-design — Design spike for LLM-driven related-projects discovery

**Category:** `research`
**Status:** `not_started`
**Dependencies:** R5 (done)

**Description:**

R7 is explicitly flagged as requiring a design pass before implementation.
Conduct a brainstorm → spec → plan cycle covering:

- How subagents are dispatched in parallel per-project (dispatch contract,
  result aggregation)
- SHA-based cache key design (what content is hashed, where the cache lives,
  invalidation strategy)
- Edge-proposal schema (how subagents return proposed edges for merge into
  `related-projects.yaml`)
- Conflict / duplication handling when multiple subagents propose the same edge

Output: a written spec and implementation plan for R7.

**Results:** _pending_

### R8 — Migrate four Rust readers to plan-state CLI

**Category:** `enhancement`
**Status:** `not_started`
**Dependencies:** R6 (done)

**Description:**

Four Rust call sites still read `.md` plan-state files directly, bypassing
`Phase::parse` validation and the structured YAML layer:

- `src/dream.rs`
- `src/survey/discover.rs`
- `src/multi_plan.rs`
- `src/main.rs`

Migrate each to use `ravel-lite state <verb>` (or the equivalent in-process
Rust API via `src/state/`) so all plan-state access is routed through the
canonical path. Once complete, `ravel-lite state migrate --delete-originals`
can safely remove `.md` originals; running it before R8 is complete would
break these readers.

**Results:** _pending_

### R7 — LLM-driven discovery for related-projects (subagent parallelism + SHA caching)

**Category:** `research`
**Status:** `not_started`
**Dependencies:** R5 (done), R7-design

**Description:**

Given a set of projects, dispatch LLM subagents in parallel to analyse each
project's README / backlog / memory and propose sibling / parent-of edges.
SHA-based cache (keyed on per-project content hash) avoids re-analysing
unchanged projects. Output merges into the global `related-projects.yaml`.

**Results:** _pending_

### Remove Claude Code `--debug-file` workaround once version exceeds 2.1.116

**Category:** `maintenance`
**Status:** `not_started`
**Dependencies:** none

**Description:**

`invoke_interactive` in `src/agent/claude_code.rs` passes
`--debug-file /tmp/claude-debug.log` as a workaround for a TUI
rendering failure in Claude Code ≤2.1.116. The root cause was not
found; debug mode happens to mask it via an unknown upstream mechanism.

When the installed `claude` binary is updated past 2.1.116, remove both
`args.push` lines adding `--debug-file` and `/tmp/claude-debug.log`.
Verify that the Work phase TUI renders correctly without the flag
before closing.

**Caveat — a version bump alone is insufficient.** The fix is empirical: debug
mode masks the TUI failure via an unknown upstream mechanism, not a documented
patch. A later claude version may have bumped past 2.1.116 without actually
touching the offending code path. Before removing the workaround:

1. Reproduce the original TUI failure on the current binary *without* the flag
   (run `ravel-lite run` against a real plan, watch the Work phase render).
2. If the bug no longer reproduces without the flag, adding the flag should
   also make no observable difference — confirm that.
3. Only then remove the two `args.push` lines.

An attempt on claude 2.1.117 was rolled back unverified — the code change is
trivial (27-line deletion, produced by a subagent, reverted via `git checkout`)
but the TUI verification step cannot be done by a subagent (no tty) and was
not done by a human.

**Results:** _pending_
