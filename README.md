# Raveloop

> An orchestration loop for LLM development cycles.
> Compose. Reflect. Dream. Triage. Repeat.

Multi-agent orchestrator for backlog-driven LLM development. Supports
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and
[Pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) as selectable
agent backends, with shared parameterized phase files and pluggable
configuration.

A single Rust binary (`raveloop`) with a
[Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs) TUI. See
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the module layout,
message model, and agent trait.

## Phase Cycle

```
work → analyse-work → git-commit-work → [continue?] →
reflect → git-commit-reflect → [dream trigger?] →
dream → git-commit-dream →
triage → git-commit-triage → [continue?] → work
```

- **work** (interactive) — user steers task selection, implements task
- **analyse-work** (headless) — examines git diff, produces session
  log and commit message from ground truth
- **reflect** (headless) — distils learnings into durable memory
- **dream** (headless, conditional) — lossless memory rewrite when
  word count exceeds baseline + headroom
- **triage** (headless) — adjusts backlog, dispatches subagents for
  cross-plan propagation
- **git-commit-\*** — per-phase audit trail commits

## Principles

- **No magic.** All config, prompts, phase state, and memory are
  readable files on disk. Nothing is embedded or hidden.
- **Visible, auditable, adjustable.** Every input is a file the user
  can inspect and edit. Every state transition writes to the filesystem.
- **Agents are subprocesses.** The orchestrator spawns CLI processes,
  reads their JSON stream output, and renders progress. It never calls
  LLM APIs directly.
